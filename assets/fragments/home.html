<h1 class="h2">Welcome</h1>
<p class="text-justify">
    I am a mathematics student with a primary interest in algebra, combinatorics, number theory, and cryptography. I am also a self-taught Python/web programmer and web developer (back-end) with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. These two domains complement each other, and I like to learn and explore new horizons in research for innovative solutions. I am motivated, dynamic, creative, and ready to face problems and obstacles.
